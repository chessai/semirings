synopsis:      two monoids as one, in holy haskimony
description:
  Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids and semigroups. A monoid has an appending operation `<>` (or `mappend`),
  and an identity element, `mempty`. A semigroup has an appending `<>` operation, but does not require a `mempty` element.
  .
  A Semiring has two appending operations, `plus` and `times`, and two respective identity elements, `zero` and `one`.
  .
  More formally, a Semiring R is a set equipped with two binary relations `+` and `*`, such that:
  .
  (R,+) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0,
  .
  (R,*) is a monoid with identity element 1,
  .
  (*) left and right distributes over addition, and
  .
  multiplication by '0' annihilates R.
